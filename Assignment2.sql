		### QUE 4
-- Find the difference between the total number of city entries in the table and the number of distinct city entries in the table. 
-- In other words, if N is the number of city entries in station, and N1 is the number of distinct city names in station, 
-- write a query to find the value of N-N1 from station. [table: station]
SELECT COUNT(city) AS N
FROM station;  # N = 501
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT city) AS N1
FROM station; #N1 = 471

SELECT COUNT(city) - COUNT(DISTINCT city)
FROM station;  
-- Result:30  #(501 - 471)





	### QUE.5 Answer the following
SELECT * FROM station;

## a. Query the list of CITY names starting with vowels (i.e., a, e, i, o, or u) from STATION. 
# Your result cannot contain duplicates. [Hint: Use RIGHT() / LEFT() methods ]
SELECT DISTINCT(city) FROM station WHERE city LIKE 'a%';  
-- Result: 26(a)+18(e)+1(i)+12(o)+5(u) = 62

SELECT DISTINCT(city) AS CITY
FROM station 
WHERE LEFT(city,1) IN ('a','e','i','o','u');
-- 62 Rows

SELECT DISTINCT CITY 
FROM STATION 
WHERE CITY LIKE 'A%' OR CITY LIKE 'E%' OR CITY LIKE 'I%' OR CITY LIKE 'O%' OR CITY LIKE 'U%';
-- Result:  62

SELECT DISTINCT CITY
FROM STATION 
WHERE CITY REGEXP '^[aeiouAEIOU]';
-- Result:  62



## b. Query the list of CITY names from STATION which have vowels (i.e., a, e, i, o, and u) as both their first and last characters. Your result cannot contain duplicates.
SELECT DISTINCT CITY
FROM STATION
WHERE LOWER(LEFT(CITY,1)) IN ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u') AND
      LOWER(RIGHT(CITY,1)) IN ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u');
-- 26 Rows

SELECT DISTINCT city
FROM  station
WHERE city RLIKE '^[aeiouAEIOU].*[aeiouAEIOU]$';
-- 26 rows



## c. Query the list of CITY names from STATION that do not start with vowels. Your result cannot contain duplicates.
SELECT DISTINCT City
FROM station
WHERE LEFT(city, 1) NOT IN ('a','e','i','o','u');
-- 409 rows

SELECT DISTINCT CITY 
FROM STATION 
WHERE CITY NOT RLIKE '^[aeiouAEIOU].*$';
-- 409 rows



## d. Query the list of CITY names from STATION that either do not start with vowels or do not end with vowels. 
-- Your result cannot contain duplicates. [table: station]
SELECT DISTINCT(city) AS CITY
FROM station 
WHERE LEFT(city,1) NOT IN ('a','e','i','o','u') OR
	  RIGHT(city,1) NOT IN ('a','e','i','o','u');
-- 445 Rows

SELECT DISTINCT CITY 
FROM STATION 
WHERE CITY NOT RLIKE '^[aeiouAEIOU].*[aeiouAEIOU]$';
-- 445 Rows

SELECT DISTINCT city
FROM   station
WHERE  city REGEXP '^[^aeiouAEIOU]|[^aeiouAEIOU]$';
-- 445 Rows




### QUE 6)
-- Write a query that prints a list of employee names having a salary greater than $2000 per month 
-- who have been employed for less than 36 months. 
-- Sort your result by descending order of salary. [table: emp]
SELECT * FROM Emp 
WHERE Salary > 2000
	AND Hire_Date >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE, INTERVAL 36 MONTH)
ORDER BY salary DESC;
-- 31 rows




## QUE. 7)
-- How much money does the company spend every month on salaries for each department? [table: employee]
# Expected Result
-- +--------+--------------+

-- |     20 |     12300.00 |
-- |     30 |      1675.00 |
-- +--------+--------------+
-- 3 rows in set (0.002 sec)
SELECT * FROM employee; #empid, fname, lname, deptno, salary

SELECT deptno, SUM(salary) AS total_salary
FROM employee
GROUP BY deptno
ORDER BY total_salary DESC;
#Result:
